Digitalus CMS is a new kind of CMS.  The focus of this open source project is usable software as opposed to endless lists of features.  We added a very flexible API to this base so you can customize virtually any aspect of the system.  This creates a simple and elegant platform that you can use for a wide range of sites and requirements.

_"The administration interface is jaw-droppingly simple and this is encouraging when considering the varying amounts of knowledge that a client might or might not have at managing a Website."_...[CMS Wire - August 2008](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/digitalus-a-web-cms-built-on-zend-framework-003001.php)

# What happened to Digitalus Site Manager? #

People have come to know the project as Digitalus CMS, so we ported it from http://code.google.com/p/digitalus-site-manager/ where it was **downloaded 20,000+ times** to avoid confusion.
